UFO Level-1: Automatic Table and Date Search files
Project Summary: In this project I created a UFO webpage, that allows the user to input a date, and have the page return the data in each column for only the selected date.  The code imports the filtered data from the data sheet and renders a table in a “table-striped” format.  The code also refreshes the page upon each filter button click.
Technical: The HTML file utilizes a bootstrap framework, calls on a CSS file for styling, calls on images and data, and calls on a JavaScript file for the primary feature and function scripting.
